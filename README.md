# The Mandelbrot set

In mathematics, the Mandelbrot set is a fractal.
This means you can zoom in indefinitely and the same patterns will occur.
In this assignment you will be making a Mandelbrot yourself.

## Configuration
After you cloned this repository, open it in PyCharm.
Reuse your environment from Homework Assignment 0,
and install all additionally required packages from `requirement.txt`.

## Starting point

Weâ€™ve provided three files which are the starting point of this
assignment. In the file `src/mandel.py` you should define the functions,
which we already named. In the file `src/gui.py`, we provided a
basic Graphical User Interface (GUI) such that we get results on the
screen. It is made using Tkinter. Finally, the
`src/main.py` file calls the functions defined in the other
files, and has the main loop that keeps the interface running.

**Note:** We only provided the function names, and arguments.
